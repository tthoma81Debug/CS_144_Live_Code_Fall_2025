<h1>Hey! CS 144 Students in Dr. Thomas's Class. Yes You!</h1>
<p>Ok, listen. This is where the coding examples go. I'll update these things in class constantly, so if you hear me say "i just pushed the code" that means i just updated whats here
with what's on my laptop.</p>
<h3>tldr: Click the folders on the left, find the code. Copy/paste. Avoid columns that say "Commit"</h3>
<h3>If you see red and green highlighting, go back and try again. That code won't work.</h3>
<p>Ok so here's the thing. This website might look super confusing when you first see it. That's fine. Learning to connect to these tools and sync software
is usually something that gets covered in later classes. </p>
<p>ok so, now that you know "what it is" Let me answer the question you are probably wondering "How do I get the code you are working on" or "How do i find that example."
</p>
<h3>Here is what you do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You click the folder on the <b>left</b> up above that matches the project</li>
  <li>You click the folder called "src" or look for files that end in ".java"</li>
  <li>You find the file that I am working on or that you are looking for</li>
  <li>You open the IntelliJ Idea IDE and either make a new file in your project at that spot or open the file if you have it</li>
  <li>You copy and paste everything in the website into the file</li>
  <li>You save the file</li>
  <li>You run the file (usually a green triangle button)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative, you can</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click the green 'Code' button and then 'Download Zip'</li>
  <li>Right click the zipped file that downloads and extract it (should be an option for that. might have to dig through the menu a little)</li>
  <li>open the extracted folder and find the file you need</li>
  <li>copy/paste that file into your project</li>
</ul>
<h3>But</h3>
<p>DON'T CLICK ANYTHING UNDER THE WORD 'COMMIT.' OR IN A COLUMN THAT SAYS COMMIT. WATCH OUT FOR THAT WORD LIKE...IDK. Why? Well, the code will be highlighting all red and green</p>
<p>That green is new stuff. The red is old deleted stuff. Yellow is different stuff. You'll copy/paste all of it, both versions, at the same time. That's like....</p>
<p>Well, it won't break anything, but it won't work, and it will be annoying, so don't do that. The computer will give you a lot of reasons why it won't compile. Most of them are just wrong. There is only one reason. The code is like, a bunch of copies at different points in time. Not gonna work. If you see red and green highlighting behind the code, you might want to hit the back button or...ya know...it might not work.</p>
<p>pssst, if you are wondering what the word 'commit' means, it kinda means 'a package of code changes' and this whole system then just syncs it up. Super convenient. In fact, this is a commit. I'll call it 'First Commit' and it will essentially have a bunch of green for all these new lines</p>
<h3>Problems/Errors/Explosions</h3>
<p>ok, now, sometimes things don't work right. If it doesn't go right, email me or show me or come to office hours. I'd put it here but well....the spammers will never let me here the end of it.
<p>But I can tell you it's at the top of the syllabus, which is at the top of the Administrative Module in Canvas. ....Oh, and if something blows up, definitely get the fire department on it, but nothing you do to the software should make it do that.</p>
<p>but whatever you do, do NOT under any circumstances, share this page with an English instructor. Why? well umm, reasons. lots of reasons, fragments, capitalization catastrophes, run-ons, starting sentences with conjunctions, references to the second person.  it's not gonna look nice, but hey, if you're still reading this, than maybe your coding knowledge improved, or your confidence in learning to code, so yeah, it's good. But oh, i should say, the English teacher is right. For formal stuff, you want all the stuff. That way you look smart, even though we don't really talk that way, especially for like resumes and formal business communications. </p>
<p>peace out</p>
